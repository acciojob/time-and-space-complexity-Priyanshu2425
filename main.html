	<h1>Time & Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is the analysis of how long
	an algorithm takes in terms of executed commands which is
	an indicator of how efficient is an algorithm.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is the amount of space taken 
	by an algorithm during its runtime generally preferred to be O(n).</p>
